  holy-water:
    cost: 100
    weight: 20
    effect: "Quaffing a potion of holy water cures lycanthropy and, for non-chaotics, cures all illnesses; chaotics take damage instead. It can be thrown at or wielded against demons, undead, and lycanthropes to cause 2d6 damage. Dipping an object into holy water can uncurse or bless them, using up the potion; the objects dipped do not get wet."
