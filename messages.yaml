  You feel rushing air tickle your nose: "You applied a tin whistle while deaf."
  You feel vibrations: "A beam-type wand was zapped, but it was blocked by a door while out of your sight."
  You feel that monsters are aware of your presence: "You quaffed a cursed potion of invisibility, or a nearby monster has cast the aggravate monster spell. This wakes up all sleeping monsters on the level, and there is a one-fifth chance that paralyzed monsters are unparalyzed. The Wizard of Yendor may also invoke this effect as a means of remote harassment."
  You feel aggravated at the invisible <monster>: "A monster drank a cursed potion of invisibility; this will reveal its location to you."
  You feel like a rabble-rouser: "You invoked the Sceptre of Might and are now causing conflict."
  You feel the tension decrease around you: "You invoked the Sceptre of Might (or it left your main inventory), and you are no longer causing conflict."
  You feel a surge of power, but nothing happens: "You invoked the Sceptre of Might, but you were already causing conflict by other means, e.g. a ring of conflict."
  You feel like someone is helping you: "The phrase occurs with many instances of curse removal - this includes reading any scroll of remove curse, casting the spell of remove curse, and stepping on a magic trap and getting the remove curse effect, which is the same as an uncursed scroll. This applies even if no items were cursed."
  You feel like you need some help: "You read a noncursed scroll of remove curse while confused."
  You feel as if you need some help: "A monster has used the curse items spell against you, and attempted to curse something in your inventory."
  You feel a malignant aura surround you: "The cursed items spell cursed at least one random item in your inventory."
  You feel a malignant aura surround the magic-absorbing blade: "Magicbane caught and absorbed the cursed items spell; it will resist with a 95% chance."
  You feel dead inside: "You genocided your original race or role while polymorphed into another form."
  You feel better: "You quaffed a potion of healing or cast the healing spell at yourself."
  You feel much better: "You quaffed a potion of extra healing, cast the extra healing spell at yourself, or had HP restored from prayer."
  You feel much slimmer: "As a result of prayer, you temporarily gained the ability to pass through walls. This happens if you were stuck in a wall, but there was no safe place to teleport you to."
  You feel hemmed in again: "Your temporary phasing power wore off, and you are still stuck in a wall."
  You feel a change coming over you: "You are polymorphing as a result of eating a chameleon or doppelganger corpse, or stepping on a polymorph trap."
  You feel rather <monster>-ish: "You tried to polymorph into a monster form that has been genocided."
  You feel like a new <race>!: "You polymorphed into your own race."
  You feel like a new <monster>!: "You polymorphed into a monster while already being that monster; this is treated as returning to your normal form, then immediately resuming your previous form." 
  You feel shuddering vibrations: "You polymorphed a pile of items (armor, corpses, gold and/or scrolls) with a wand or spell of polymorph."
  You feel a wrenching sensation: "You stepped on a teleport trap or level teleport trap trap while magic resistant, sat on a throne and got the teleportation effect, or else failure to read a spellbook caused a teleportation effect."
  You feel disoriented for a moment: "An attempt to teleport or branchport failed for some reason, e.g. interference from the Amulet of Yendor."
  You feel worried about <your <pet>>: "Your pet's nutrition is low enough that it is starving, and the pet is out of your sight; a starving pet becomes confused from hunger, its maximum HP is temporarily reduced to 1/4 of its current value, and it will die in 250 turns unless fed, which restores its maximum HP (but not its current HP) to normal."
  You feel sad for a moment: "Your pet starved to death while out of your sight."
  You feel guilty losing your pet like this: "You displaced your pet into a trap, killing it; this incurs a -15 alignment penalty and angers your god."
  You feel good enough to do it again: "You gained a point of constitution, also exercising constitution."
  You feel restored to health: "You were healed to maximum HP, and strength is exercised."
  You feel raised to your full potential: "You were restored to maximum energy, and your maximum energy was also increased by 1-5 points; constitution is exercised."
  You feel exhausted: "You take 10-16 hit points of damage, and strength is abused."
  You feel drained of energy: "Your maximum energy is decreased by 1-10 points, and your energy is set to zero; constitution is abused."
  You feel out of shape: "You lose an experience level, unless you have drain resistance."
  You feel hemmed in!: "A werecreature called for help while you were blind or already surrounded by monsters, and one or more of them spawned out of your sight."
  You feel vaguely nervous: "The Wizard of Yendor did not harass you during an eligible turn."
  You feel a mild buzz: "You gained energy or increased your maximum energy by eating a newt corpse."
  You feel squirming in your backpack: "A troll revived from its corpse while it was in your inventory."
  You feel threatened: "This message has multiple sources: you failed to read a spellbook and woke up all sleeping monsters on the level, unparalyzing paralyzed monsters; you sat on a throne and produced the aggravate monster effect; you quaffed a nonblessed potion of monster detection when there were no other monsters on the level; or quaffed from a fountain and would have been shown monsters on the level, but there were none."
  You feel guilty: "This message has multiple sources: you ate non-vegetarian food as a Monk and incurred a -1 alignment penalty; you killed a co-aligned unicorn and suffered a -5 Luck penalty; or else, you read a blessed scroll of punishment (which has no effect)."
  You feel besieged: "You are hemmed in by monsters during the Endgame."
